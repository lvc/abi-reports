ABI Reports
===========

  This is a repository with machine-readable JSON-format backward compatibility analysis reports for hundreds of open-source C/C++ libraries. The reports are generated by the ABI Tracker project (https://github.com/lvc/upstream-tracker).
  
  Original detailed HTML-format reports are available here: https://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/
  
  The data in this repository may be redistributed under the terms of the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license.
  
  The repository is AUTO updated three times a week (Mon, Wed, Fri approx. at 11:00 UTC) after each run of the ABI Tracker.

REPORT DETAILS:

  "Version":        Analyzed version of the library
  "From":           Reference version of the library
  "BC":             Avg. backward binary compatibility rate in percents
  "Added":          The number of added symbols
  "Removed":        The number of removed symbols
  "TotalProblems":  Total number of particular backward binary compatibility problems (including warnings)
  "ObjectsAdded":   The number of added shared objects
  "ObjectsRemoved": The number of removed shared objects
  "ChangedSoname":  The number of objects with changed SONAME
  "TotalObjects":   Total shared objects

  "Src_BC":            Avg. backward source compatibility rate in percents
  "Src_TotalProblems": Total number of particular backward source compatibility problems (including warnings)

   The version of the library can be considered incompatible if: BC!=100% or Removed!=0 or ObjectsRemoved!=0 or ChangedSoname!=0

   If BC==100% then non-zero value of TotalProblems indicates minor compatibility warnings.
